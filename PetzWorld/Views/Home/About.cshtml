<h2 align="center">OUR STORY</h2>
<br />
<h3 align="center">WHO WE ARE</h3>
<br />
<p>Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. We do this by breaking down misconceptions surrounding shelter pets and celebrating the unique bond between every shelter pet and parent.</p>
